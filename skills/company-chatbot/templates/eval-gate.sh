# Chatbot eval gate . A repo that ships a chatbot lists, in
# evals/prompt-files.txt, the files that decide how the bot behaves (prompt,
# tool definitions, model, call parameters, client tool loop). When a merge of
# <target> into <base> touches one of those files, or the list itself, this
# refuses unless the bot's eval passed on exactly that content: the eval writes
# $EVAL_RECEIPT_DIR/<H>.json with pass:true only when every case passed, and H
# is a hash of the listed files AS THEY WILL BE after the merge.
#
# H: each list line is trimmed (CR, leading and trailing whitespace, a leading
# "./"); a last line without a newline still counts; empty
# lines and lines starting with # are skipped. For each remaining path, in file
# order, the line "<path> <sha256hex(content)>\n", or "<path> missing\n" when
# the file does not exist; H = sha256hex of the concatenation. Contract one-liner
# (run at the repo root; must give the same H):

# Computed here from git blobs of the would-be merge result, so a merge that pulls
# in someone else's prompt change needs a fresh eval too. Symlinks are not
# supported in the list (git hashes the link text, the one-liner the target).
# A list with no paths hashes the empty stream. Directory lines are refused.
#
# Exit 0: no list, nothing listed changed, a matching receipt, or EVAL_BLOCK=0.
# Exit 6: refuse (reason on stderr). Fails CLOSED once a list exists on either
# side: a merge result that cannot be built for any reason other than a content
# conflict (which the real merge then reports) refuses too. After a human
# resolves a conflict, run the gate again on the resolved result before merging.
# Needs git 2.38+ (merge-tree --write-tree) and jq.
